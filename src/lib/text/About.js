export default `I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating engaging and visually appealing online experiences. From designing captivating user interfaces to crafting seamless user experiences, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life through the power of code.

When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you can often find me pursuing my other interests. Photography is one of my favorite creative outlets, allowing me to capture beautiful moments and tell stories through the lens. Whether it's the breathtaking landscapes during my hikes or candid shots of everyday life, photography fuels my curiosity and sparks my imagination.

Speaking of hikes, nature has a special place in my heart. Exploring the great outdoors and challenging myself on scenic trails brings me a sense of peace and rejuvenation. The beauty of nature never ceases to amaze me, and I find inspiration in its vastness and intricacy.

Another realm that captivates me is astronomy. Gazing up at the night sky, contemplating the mysteries of the universe, and learning about celestial objects fill me with awe and wonder. It's a constant reminder of how vast and interconnected our world is.

When I need a break from coding and exploring the cosmos, I often indulge in the world of video games. Beyond being a form of entertainment, they offer unique storytelling experiences and can be a source of inspiration for my own projects. They also serve as a way to connect with others who share similar interests.

Music is the soundtrack of my life, and it accompanies me on every adventure. From soothing melodies to energizing beats, music has a way of touching my soul and evoking emotions. Whether it's playing an instrument or discovering new artists, I'm constantly seeking out new sounds to enrich my experiences.

Currently, I am pursuing a B.Sc. in computer science at the University of Minnesota. My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and software development principles. I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge and honing my skills to create meaningful and impactful digital experiences.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and getting to know more about my journey as a web developer. Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or simply share your own passions and ideas. Let's connect and create something remarkable together!`;
